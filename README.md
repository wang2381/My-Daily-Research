# My_Daily_Research

The directory contains some sample files used in my daily research on atmospheric modeling. The files include .cpp and .hpp files for my climate model, some Matlab and Bash scripts for data analysis, data cleaning, data organization, figure plotting, and parallel job submission. Some parameter files with parameters that were calibrated for model simulation.

This is a small part of my daily research and serves as part of my fourth paper titled "A potential shift from a carbon sink to a source in Amazonian peatlands under a changing climate". Just to give you a brief idea of what my research focuses on.
